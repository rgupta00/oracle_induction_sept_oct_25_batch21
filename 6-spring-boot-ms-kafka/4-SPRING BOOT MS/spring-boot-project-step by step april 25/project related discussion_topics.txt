Why we need test container?
--------------------------------
 Developers create unit tests to validate the behavior of individual components, 
 isolating them from external dependencies such as file systems,
 databases, message brokers, and third-party APIs. 
 
 However, since many applications rely on these external components, 
 developers write integration tests to ensure an application interacts
 correctly with its dependencies in a more complete environment.

 Integration testing can be challenging if developers rely on shared environments, 
 mock systems, or manual configuration of dependencies, 
 all of which can lead to brittle tests and undetected issues in production.
 
 

What is test container?
---------------------------
	Testcontainers for Java is an open-source Java library that provides
	lightweight, disposable containers as test fixtures, 
	enabling developers to run real instances of databases, 
	message brokers, web servers, and other dependencies during testing.
	By leveraging Docker, Testcontainers ensures that tests run 
	in isolated and consistent environments, independent of the host machineâ€™s configuration.

	Testcontainers integrates seamlessly with popular
	testing libraries like JUnit and TestNG, 
	making it easy for developers to write integration tests.

	Flyway is a tool that helps manage database schema migrations.
	It's a popular, open-source, and flexible tool that can be used in many technology stacks. 
	
	How Flyway works
		Flyway uses versioned SQL scripts to automate database changes 
		It can handle many SQL databases, including Postgres 
		Flyway can be integrated with many Java frameworks, such as Spring Boot 
		It can be used to create and alter a database 
		Flyway can be used to ensure that an application's schema evolves with its codebase
